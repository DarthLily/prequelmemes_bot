*Hello there!*

Welcome to the source page of u/prequelmemes_bot! Nice to meet you. First of
all, let me talk you through what the bot does and details later. *If you want*
to help the bot, please go down to the *TODO* list and find your way to
contribute! /Thanks!/

** Getting started 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on
how to deploy the project on a live system. 

*** Prerequisites

What you need is just basic installation of docker and its enabled state.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker docker-engine docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
#+END_SRC

This will install docker on your machine and enable the docker daemon.
     
** Installing and configuring
  
The only thing that needs to be done before execution is the config. The only
thing that needs to be done before execution is the config profile. In the
config profile you should fill your Reddit API details.
   
For that please follow the steps below
   
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/thecsw/prequelmemes_bot.git
cd prequelmemes_bot
mv .env.example .env
nano .env
#+END_SRC
 
After filling out the details, save and exit. You're done with installation.
 
** Deployment

In order to deploy the bot, you should have configured the =.env= file. Now, we
need to build the containers and set them running. Commands below will do the
building and deployment. The build stage might take several minutes to download
and install all the required dependencies. The time taken directly depends on
your hardware. The maintenance details are in the next part.

*NOTE* You also should have configured docker, so you can run =docker-compose=
and =docker= commands without sudo privileges. Read docker manuals or google how
to add a user to docker group.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker-compose build -t prequelmemes_bot
docker-compose up -d
#+END_SRC

That is everything. All the prequelmemes will be identified. Once and for all,
the archives will never be incomplete.

** Maintenance
*** Start the services

This will just start all services in detached mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker-compose up -d
#+END_SRC

*** Stopping the services

Do not use the =down= command as it will wipe out created containers and
images. This may cost you your database data. If you want to =down= the bot,
backup it first. However, the command below will just stop active services and
will keep the images and containers. After that, you can fire it up again.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
docker-compose stop
#+END_SRC

*** Restarting the services

This command will restart all services. 

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker-compose restart
#+END_SRC

*** Checking logs

To check how the bot is doing, use the command below to view an output from all
active services. 

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker-compose logs
#+END_SRC

*** Backing up the database

I wrote a little bash script that will copy the database contents and dump them
into a file. You need to configure the =backup.sh.example= file first. 

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./backup.sh
#+END_SRC

*** Updating source code

The =./src= folder on the host machine is volumed with =./src= folder in the
container for the service bot. There is no need for rebuilding if the source
code has changed. The following command will update the source code and restart
the services.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git pull && docker-compose restart
#+END_SRC

** Source code

The code is heavily commented and all the important modules are being separated
into different files. Looks pretty, dunno.

** Built With
 1. [[docker.com][Docker]] is the company driving the container movement and the only container
    platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. 
 2. [[https://github.com/praw-dev/praw][praw]] is Python Reddit API Wrapper. This will be the main and only package to
    connect to Reddit's API and extract desired data.
 3. [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/opencv-python][python-opencv]] is used for image transformations and computer vision problems.
 4. [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytesseract][pytesseract]] is a python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR.
 5. [[https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Pillow]] is the Python  Imaging Library by Fredrik Lundh and Contributors.
 6. [[https://github.com/byroot/pysrt][pysrt]] is a Python library used to edit or
    create SubRip files.

** Todo list

This is going to be a short todo list. If you have the true loyalty and some
free time, try to add/fix the following todo items or add your own with the
issues tab or push.

*** TODO [#C] Add a comment feature.
I don't have an idea of what to do. I made some prototypes, don't know. If the
bot is going to answer to each comment, that is just a spam.

*** DONE [#A] Port the whole thing to docker.
    CLOSED: [2018-06-30 Sat 17:44]
I find it pretty practical to run the bot in an isolated container instead on a
host machine. This whole thing may take a while...

*** DONE [#A] Port the bot's data to a server-based database.
    CLOSED: [2018-06-30 Sat 17:46]
SQLite is a good approach for some mobile applications and so on but it is bad
if you have a lot of data and want to be somewhat professional. I might go with
MySQL or PostgreSQL. 

*** DONE [#B] Get rid of tabulate.
    CLOSED: [2018-06-30 Sat 17:45]
This is a really bad logging approach, I need to get rid of the ASCII tables.
    
*** DONE [#B] Make some general fixes to the code. 
    CLOSED: [2018-06-30 Sat 17:42]
Add some little new features, replace old ones with new ones. Make a faster
version. Just a general quality assurance.

*** DONE [#A] Edit the mesage body text.
    CLOSED: [2018-05-17 Thu 21:28]
The message body text isn't perfect. It can be more prequelmemed. So yeah, if
somebody can do it, that would be awesome.

*** DONE [#A] Port the code to python3.6+
    CLOSED: [2018-05-13 Sun 18:27]
Just port the whole code. I am not talking about just using ~python3 main.py~
instead of ~python main.py~. I am talking about using the new python3+
features. Like better string formatting, like the ~print(f"{args}...")~.

*** DONE [#A] Change tqdm for another approach
    CLOSED: [2018-05-12 Sat 18:27]
tqdm is throwing some strange annoying warnings. Will need a more *manual* way
of counting things.
